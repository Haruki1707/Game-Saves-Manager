# Game-Saves Manager

Manages your game saves data making copy of each save.
Can handle many users (works as expected with steam users).

You can use a Cloud service of your preference
(I recommend one that accept versioning)
to make a copy of the folder with the save data.

We also highly recommend downloading C# automate client.
This connects directly with Steam, making all without user interaction.
